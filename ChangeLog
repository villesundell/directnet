2.0a1:
        - Rearchitected in C++
        - With connection info, include hostname and port if the connection is
          outgoing. This will aid shortcircuiting in the future, and generic
          services in the distant future.
        - GUI improvements (html view in messageboxes)
              Html viewer support tags:
              <b>sometext</b> bold text
              <i>sometext</i> italics text
              <u>sometext</u> underlined text
              <br>            newline
              You can also use colors like:
              [#blue]bluetexthere[#] 
        - You can now block users
        - Removed all threading (thanks to bd_!)
        - Distributed hash table backend.
        - Completely changed the backend message passing.
        - Far too many changes to list.

1.0.1 from 1.0.0:
        - Added gaim-plugin debug support.
        - No longer include an internal copy of GMP.
        - Autoconnection and autofind support.

1.0.0 from 1.0.0.rc5:
        - Fixed gaim-plugin const problem (just removed consts, no functional
          difference).

1.0.0rc5 from 1.0.0rc4:
        - Use pthread_cancel instead of signals (fix for Win32).
        - Check and use Sleep instead of sleep (fix for Win32).
        - Don't wait for other pthreads to close on Win32 (strange
          win32-pthreads bug(?)).
        - Const correctness.
        - a CAPITALIZATION BUG THAT CAUSED IT NOT TO COMPILE ON SOME SYSTEMS
          (PARTICULARLY dEBIAN)

1.0.0rc4 from 1.0.0rc3:
        - Properly initialized pthread_lock (fix for Win32)
        - Fixed a REALLY nasty bug on receiving connections.

1.0.0rc3 from 1.0.0rc2:
        - Fixed a bug in the lost-route detection (probably a NASTY one).
          - And another one! (Must ... not ... break ... lost-route detection!)
        - Added interruption routes whenever standard routes are added.
        - Fixed a freeze in ui-fltk upon trying to send a message to a user
          that you don't have a route to.
        - Fixed a bug that was especially prevelant with localhost connections.
        - A large number of other bugfixes.

1.0.0rc2 from 1.0.0rc1:
        - Fixed a problem that made GPG malfunction on OpenBSD.
        - Got rid of a rather pointless perror()
        - Fixed a problem with OSX calling the GUI client.
        - Fixed some FLTK issues with fl_ask etc.
        - Fixed a potentially nasty buffer overflow with dn_name.
        - Removed the outdated and broken enc-gpg (not auth-gpg).

1.0.0rc1 from Beta 0.6:
        - Authentication support through GPG
        - Many more minor fixes

Beta 0.6 from Beta 0.5:
        - Distribution changes (configure, etc)
        - Updated (no longer inaccurate) README

Beta 0.5 from Alpha 0.4:
        - Gaim plugin
        - Cyfer encryption
        - Better Win32 support (MingW32 with pthreads)
