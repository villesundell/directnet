This is a short documentation of protocol commands.
All protocol commands are a three-character command followed by a two-char version number followed
by ;-delimited parameters followed by a null terminator.
There are four types.  Direct, routed, nonlooping unrouted and nonrepeating unrouted.  Direct
commands are sent directly over a connection and are not continued.  Routed commands have a set
route as the first parameter, and all of the nodes along that route strip off their name then
continue the transfer until the data is sent to the last node on the list (at which point it will
have an empty route).  Urouted commands are the rare few that simply emit throughout the network.
Nonlooping unrouted messages contain a parameter for the route that they have taken to get to
the current node, andy any other parameters.  Nonrepeating unrouted messages contain a parameter
for the transmission key (so that they are not retransmitted), and any other necessary parameters.
