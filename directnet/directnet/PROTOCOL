This is a short documentation of protocol commands.
All protocol commands are a three-character command followed by a two-char version number followed
by ;-delimited parameters followed by a null terminator.
There are three types.  Direct, routed, and unrouted.  Direct commands are sent directly over a
connection and are not continued.  Routed commands have a set route as the first parameter, and all
of the nodes along that route strip off their name then continue the transfer until the data is
sent to the last node on the list (at which point it will have an empty route).  Unrouted commands
are the rare few that simply emit throughout the network.  These contain a parameter for the
transmission key (so that they are not retransmitted), and any other necessary parameters.
