This is DirectNet, the serverless instant messaging system.

NOTE: THIS VERSION DOES NOT SUPPORT ENCRYPTION!  ALL MESSAGES TRANSMITTED ARE SENT IN CLEAR TEXT
TO ANYONE IN YOUR ROUTE ON THE NETWORK!

Here's a quick overview of the commands:

connect <host>
        Connect to another user running DirectNet by hostname or IP address, and establish a route
       to the user.
        Example: connect 192.168.1.1

say <name> <message>
        Send a message to a user that you've established a route with.
        Example: say Gregor Hello!

find <name>
        Establish a route to someone you don't have a direct connection to.
        Example: find Gregor


If that's not enough, wait for a future version of the client - this is, after all, an alpha
release.
