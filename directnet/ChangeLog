CVS from 1.0.0rc2:
        - Fixed a bug in the lost-route detection (probably a NASTY one).
          - And another one! (Must ... not ... break ... lost-route detection!)
        - Added interruption routes whenever standard routes are added.
        - Fixed a freeze in ui-fltk upon trying to send a message to a user
          that you don't have a route to.

1.0.0rc2 from 1.0.0rc1:
        - Fixed a problem that made GPG malfunction on OpenBSD.
        - Got rid of a rather pointless perror()
        - Fixed a problem with OSX calling the GUI client.
        - Fixed some FLTK issues with fl_ask etc.
        - Fixed a potentially nasty buffer overflow with dn_name.
        - Removed the outdated and broken enc-gpg (not auth-gpg).
