There are locks all over DirectNet, so this is a quick reference of them.

uiLoaded:
        Set to 1 once the UI is fully loaded - all UI functions should spinlock on this.

displayLock:
        Any UI function should lock on this.

dn_name_set:
        This lock prevents connections before dn_name is set.  When dn_name is set, set to 1.
