Todo for 1.0.2:

        - Convert code to C++


Todo for 1.1.0:

        - Shortcircuiting of routes. That is, if a route is A-B-C-D-E-F-G, and
        B has a connection to F, rather than B sending the message to C, it
        will send it to F. Furthermore, a command will be used to try to
        generate short circuits.

        - Routing by encryption keys instead of nicknames.

        - Distributed hash table method of looking up users. The current method
        is in O(n^n), which is awful. A DHT with no redundancy would be in
        O(log(n)), a DHT with redundancy in O(log(n)^r) where r is the level of
        redundancy.  The planned hash table is very much like Chord, but with some changes


Todo later:

        - Generic services support. That is, if directly connected to a user,
        allow easy access to things like gnomemeeting through directnet.
