Hash commands are sent along the hash table identified by the third parameter
to the node with the nearest encryption to the encryption key in the fourth
parameter. They are routed messages.

Returnable hash commands also have the taken thusfar in the fifth parameter.
They are also routed messages.

Hash return commands have a route, like other routed messages, but have the
hash table identifier.

[HTI = hash table identifier]
[Keys as used by the DHT are SHA-256'd from the desired data to look up
(whether an encryption key, name, or anything else)]
[None of this is implemented yet]
