The DirectNet core, the dumb UI, the FLTK UI, the hub pseudo-UI, the gaim plugin pseudo-UI, the
fake encryption module and the Cyfer encryption module were written by Gregor Richards.

Some parts of the core were contributed by Bryan Donlan.

Some parts of the gaim plugin and FLTK UI were contributed by "Solarius".

Cyfer is used by DirectNet, but is not Gregor's code.  Please see
src/enc-cyfer/cyfer for more information Cyfer.


DirectNet has a modular design.  If you would like to submit a new UI or encryption module, the
easiest way is to modify the dumb UI or fake encryption module and the Makefile in that directory,
and make it compile that way.  When you have it working, you can submit the entire modified
directory to the patch tracker on the SourceForge page
( http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/directnet/ ), and I (Gregor) will integrate it properly.
