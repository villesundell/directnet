The 'sce' command generates short-circuits on a route. The concept of short-
circuiting is that, given a route in a routed message, the node will forward it
to the /latest/ node on the route it has a connection to. 'sce' attempts to
establish these short circuits.

Basically, a 'sce' command is sent after a route has been established by Hfn or
Hfr. The algorithm is too convoluted to explain in pure English, so the
pseudocode is included here.

receiveSce(msg, iconnection):
        # 1) Steps regarding the connection it was sent over
        msg.ips.push_back iconnection.remoteIp
        # (This side should always have a better perspective on the remote IP)
        
        # 2) Steps regarding this node
        while msg.ips.length > msg.route.length + 1:
                msg.ips.pop_back
        if msg.ips.length == msg.route.length + 1:
                connect msg.ips.pop_back

        # 3) Continuation
        if route.length > 0:
                oconnection = connection(msg.route.pop_front)
                oconnection.send(msg)
