In the present incarnation, the only type of chat room supported is owned chat
rooms. These chat rooms are given names prefixed with '#'.

To find an owned chat room, it is searched for on the DHT. The key is:
\x01oc<name>
Where <name> is the name except for the '#' prefix. A Hag command is sent, so
that the room is claimed by the searcher if it does not already exist. Upon
receiving the corresponding Hgr command, a Cjo is sent to join the chat room.
If it did not already exist, it is simply created by the node with themselves
as the only member.

Unowned chats have not yet been implemented. When they are:
1) They will likely be prefixed with '$'
2) The key will probably be: \x11uc<name>
3) Propogation will likely involve choosing an arbitrary set of
   "representatives."

This document lists the chat protocol commands.
