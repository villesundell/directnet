This document is intended to aid in the creation of DirectNet-compatible
clients. It does not describe the protocol itself, which is described in the
documents PROTOCOL, DHT and CHAT, but focuses on the actual lifespan of a node
in the DirectNet network.

When a DirectNet node connects to another node, a handshaking command, 'dni',
is sent. This informs the other node of the encryption key of this node, as
well as checking the protocol compatibility.

The connecting side then sends a DHT establishment command, 'Hin', which at
present will show that the connecting node is in no DHTs. If the receiving side
is on any DHTs, it sends the list back in an 'Hir' command. If it isn't, it
creates three (yes, three) DHTs with arbitrary HTIs and sends those back in an
'Hir' command. The unestablished connecting side will then send an 'Hag' to add
its name to each hash (and check if some other user owns the nick), and start
establishing itself into the DHTs. The name added to the hash (and searched for
when looking for users) is the generic form of the name. At the moment that
merely means that it's lower-case.

A node is established in the DHT when:
 * It knows its second predecessor, first predecessor, first successor and
   second successor.
 * It has enough binary divisions that the smallest one is self-referential

To accomplish establishment, the node sends an 'Hfn' command to find neighbors,
and upon successfully finding neighbors, starts sending 'Hfn' commands to find
divisions.

After that, all protocol commands can be sent and received by both parties.
Neither functions as a server or a client, they are equal nodes.

A node does not need to send any messages to disconnect, but it is preferable
to send a 'dis' command. The 'dis' command propogates to all nodes that
recognize the key. If the exiting node does not send a 'dis' command, all of
the nodes that it is connected to will when they detect the disconnect.
