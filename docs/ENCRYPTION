The encryption used for all encrypted messages in DirectNet is RSA with 1024
bit keys, over AES with 128-bit keys and block size, using CBC. SHA-256 is used
for all encryption.

An encrypted message consists of the following:
* the AES symmetric key, encrypted and signed with RSA
* a 2-byte big endian modulo for the encrypted message. This is the number of
  bytes into the last block that are actually used
* the message, encrypted with the AES key
