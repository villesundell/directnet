<h1>Readme</h1>
This is the README file from DirectNet ALPHA 0.3<br>
<br>
<pre>
<font face=courier>
This is DirectNet, the serverless instant messaging system.

NOTE: THIS VERSION DOES NOT SUPPORT ENCRYPTION!  ALL MESSAGES TRANSMITTED ARE SENT IN CLEAR TEXT
TO ANYONE IN YOUR ROUTE ON THE NETWORK!

Here's a quick overview of the commands:

/c <host>
        Connect to another user running DirectNet by hostname or IP address, and establish a route
       to the user.
        Example: /c 192.168.1.1

/t <name>
        Enable chatting with a certain user.  After enabling chatting, anything you type that
       doesn't start with '/' will be sent as a message to the user you're chatting with.
        Example: /t Gregor

/f <name>
        Establish a route to someone you don't have a direct connection to.
        Example: /f Gregor

/q
        Quit


If that's not enough, wait for a future version of the client - this is, after all, an alpha
release.
